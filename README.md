# [illuminati](https://dekal.github.io/illuminati/)
[The Illuminati](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-illuminati) is a purported secret society consisting of world governments, corporations and celebrities that play an important role in global affairs. Many believe the goal of the organization is to establish a global totalitarian government known as the "New World Order.".

Instead of "New World Order", this project will bring new light to those are in confusion, to bring knowledge upon those miserable lives coding in a ruthless way. This is not a conspiracy, this is reality, this is public and accessible to those in need.
